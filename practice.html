     <h2 id="'main-heading">I've got that friday feeling!</h2>
      <h3 id="secondary-heading">Why? Because it's Friday and this is Friday's website.</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">I'm hoping by now you know what day it is, I will not I repeat will not be telling you again. So honestly do not even ask, I swear to god. Either way the weekend is fast approaching, unfortunately though I'm not quite as excited as I would normally be</p>
     <h4 id="secondary-heading">The reasons for this in no particular order are...</h4>
  <div id="unordered-list">
      <ul>
        <li class="unlist-item">I'm away from home at present and it's not for a particularly exciting reason</li>
        <li class="unlist-item">Me and my girlfriend drove for 6 hours last night starting at 5pm</li>
        <li class="unlist-item">We will be doing the same drive back tomorrow most likely</li>
        <li class="unlist-item">Due to the driving I didn't sleep well so I am tired</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
    <p class="paragraph">All in all I've had better run up's to the weekend if I had my way my ideal Friday would be going a lot different</p>
       <h5 id="secondary-heading" >Enjoy this list (in order mind you) of what a perfect friday must consist of.</h5>  
<div id="ordered-list">
       <ol>
        <li class="list-order">Not have a zero bank balance</li>
        <p id="ordered"> Noone wants to be skint going into a weekend do they.</p>
        <li class="list-order">Have a nice wholesome day trip planned</li>
        <p id="ordered">Having a hike on the cards on a sunday to look forward to, a bit of rest and relaxation what could be better.</p>
        <li class="list-order">Be in the pub from about 6:30/7pm</li>
        <p id="ordered">I mean this is self explanatory really.</p>
        <li class="list-order">Decent weather</li>
        <p id="ordered">The temperature is much less of a factor but clear skies are definitely important. Find me a person that enjoys the rain I dare you.</p>
        <li class="list-order">Football's being shown</li>
        <p id="ordered">Premier League, Euros, World Cup. I dont need to watch it all even just a half is a bonus. Nations league does not count as it's truly just a waste of everyone's time.</p>
